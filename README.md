Several projects involving data analysis are covered in this section (involving data mining, data aggregation and short analysis). All of those projects are SQL-based. A large database can be handled and quantitative analysis can be done using the query language SQL.

The focus of each project differs, and the context is clearly explained within the project's scopes.
